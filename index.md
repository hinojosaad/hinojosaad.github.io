## Welcome to Adrián Hinojosa Calleja's web

# Who I am

I recently finished my Phd Mathematics at Universitat de Barcelona and I'm currently doing a Data Science bootcamp at IT Academy. I do research in Probability, more specifically in Stochastic Partial Differential Equation.

I'm passionate about Science and its dissemination, in the past I've been part of the following initiatives (in Spanish):

- SCI DF (Volunteer)
- BYMAT (Chair of Scientific Comittee)
- Festival Matemático
